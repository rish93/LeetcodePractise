* Inheritance is another important concept in object-oriented programming.
* * Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class acquires
* * the properties and behaviors of the parent class.
* *  It’s essentially creating a parent-child relationship between classes.
* * In Java, we will use inheritance mainly for code reusability and maintainability.
* *The keyword “extends” is used to inherit a class in Java. The “extends”
* * keyword indicates that we are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
