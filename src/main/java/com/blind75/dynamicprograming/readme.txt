Dynamic programming is when you use past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier.

A good example is solving the Fibonacci sequence for n=1,000,002.

This will be a very long process, but what if I give you the results for n=1,000,000 and n=1,000,001? Suddenly the problem just became more manageable.

Dynamic programming is used a lot in string problems, such as the string edit problem. You solve a subset(s) of the problem and then use that information to solve the more difficult original problem.

With dynamic programming, you store your results in some sort of table generally. When you need the answer to a problem, you reference the table and see if you already know what it is. If not, you use the data in your table to give yourself a stepping stone towards the answer.

The Cormen Algorithms book has a great chapter about dynamic programming.
 AND it's free on Google Books! Check it out here.

- The DP video from Coderbyte on YouTube.
 This was the most helpful one for me, personally.

 Alvin did an amazing job on explaining the common DP problems
 through live coding and tons of animated illustrations. This was also suggested by a few ppl in the comments.

- Grinding leetcode using this list
https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/662866/DP-for-Beginners-Problems-or-Patterns-or-Sample-Solutions,
thanks to Lost_Extrovert for sharing this. It was really helpful for me
 to build up my confidence by solving the problems on the list one after another
 (I didn't finish them all before I got my offer, but I learned a lot from the practice).
 There are some other lists which I think quite useful too:
