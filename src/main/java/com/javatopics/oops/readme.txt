When to use Abstract class, when to interface


	•	Abstract Class:
	•	When you want to provide some common functionality (shared code) for subclasses.
	•	When you expect multiple closely related classes that need to share behavior and fields.
	•	When inheritance is needed (extending the abstract class).
	•	Interface:
	•	When you want to define a contract that any class can implement, regardless of where it is in the class hierarchy.
	•	When you need to implement multiple behaviors in a class (since Java supports multiple inheritance with interfaces).
	•	When you want to ensure that implementing classes provide certain methods, without requiring a common ancestor.
