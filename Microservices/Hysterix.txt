Why hysterix:

_>Short answer: mainly to Stop cascading failures in a complex distributed system.

  I don't have any meaningful alternative response to provide, why would I need a circuit breaker at all?
  This question is relevant only if your server serves just a single REST end point (and a single HTTP verb). But almost always, that is not the case. Even the 'micro'services will have combination of multiple endpoints + multiple http verbs. You don't want one endpoint to hung up on a slow upstream service and pileup threads after threads keep waiting and eventually bringdown your entire application.

  Take a look at the official documentation

  What Is Hystrix For? --- Hystrix is designed to do the following:

  Give protection from and control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed (typically over the network) via third-party
  client libraries.
  Stop cascading failures in a complex distributed system.
  Fail fast and rapidly recover.
  Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.
  Enable near real-time monitoring, alerting, and operational control.
  "Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible" is just one among the features that hystrix offers.
