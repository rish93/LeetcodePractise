COMPONENT OF MIROSERVICE

Eureka: Probably the first microservice to be UP. Eureka is a service registry,
means , it knows which ever microservices are running and in which port.
Eureka is deploying as a sperate application and we can use @EnableEurekaServer
annotation along with @SpringBootAPplication to make that app a eureka server.
So our eureka service registery is UP and running. From now on all microservices
will be registered in this eureka server by using @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation
along with @SpringBootAPplication in all deployed microservices.

Zuul: ZUUL is a load balancer , routing application and reverse proxy server
as well. That is before we were using apache for reverse proxy things ,
now , for microservices we can use ZUUL. Advantage is, in ZUUL we can programatically
set configurations, like if /customer/* comes go to this microservice like that.
Also ZUUL can act as a load balancer as well , which will pick the appropriate microservice
in a round robin fashion. SO how does the ZUUL knows the details of microservices,
the answer is eureka. It will work along with eureka to get microservice details.
And in fact this ZUUL is also a Eureka client where we should mark using @EnableDiscoveryClient,
thats how these 2 apps(Eureka and zuul) linked.

Ribbbon: Ribbon use for load balancing. This is already available inside ZUUL,
in which zuul is using Ribbon for load balancing stuff. Microservices are identified
by service-name in properties file. IF we run 2 instances of one microservices in
different port, this will be identified by Eureka and along with Ribbon(Inside zuul),
 requests will be redirected in a balanced way.

Aws ALB , NGINX , AWS Api gateway etc: There are alternatives for all the above mentioned things.
Aws is having own load balancer, service discovery , api gateway etc .
Not only AWS all cloud platofrms ,like Azure, have these. Its depends which one to use.

Adding a general question as well , How these microservices
communicate each other: Using Resttemplate
or Feignclient actual rest API can be called
or Message queues like Rabbit MQ etc can be used .
