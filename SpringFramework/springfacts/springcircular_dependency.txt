Circular dependencies in Spring Boot occur when two or more beans depend on each other,
forming a cycle. Spring cannot determine which bean to initialize first, leading to a
 BeanCurrentlyInCreationException (especially with constructor injection).



 1. Refactor Code (Recommended Approach)
 The most robust solution is to redesign the components to eliminate
 the circular dependency. This might involve:
 Introducing an intermediary service: Create a new service that both
 dependent beans can interact with, breaking the direct circular reference.
 Separating concerns: Reorganize the classes to ensure that responsibilities
 are clearly defined and dependencies flow in one direction.
 Using interfaces: Program to interfaces rather than concrete implementations,
 promoting loose coupling.
 2. Use @Lazy Annotation
 The @Lazy annotation can be applied to a dependency in one of
  the circularly dependent beans. This tells Spring to initialize
  that specific bean lazily, creating a proxy and deferring the
  actual bean creation until it's first used.
 Java

 @Component
 public class BeanA {
     private final BeanB beanB;

     @Autowired
     public BeanA(@Lazy BeanB beanB) { // Mark BeanB as lazy
         this.beanB = beanB;
     }
 }

 @Component
 public class BeanB {
     private final BeanA beanA;

     @Autowired
     public BeanB(BeanA beanA) {
         this.beanA = beanA;
     }
 }
 3. Use Setter Injection Instead of Constructor Injection
 While constructor injection is generally preferred for mandatory
 dependencies, setter injection can resolve circular dependencies
 because Spring can create the bean instances first and then set the
  dependencies later via the setter methods.
 Java

 @Component
 public class BeanA {
     private BeanB beanB;

     @Autowired
     public void setBeanB(BeanB beanB) {
         this.beanB = beanB;
     }
 }

 @Component
 public class BeanB {
     private BeanA beanA;

     @Autowired
     public void setBeanA(BeanA beanA) {
         this.beanA = beanA;
     }
 }
 4. Enable Circular References (Not Recommended for Production)
 Spring Boot allows you to explicitly enable circular references by
 setting spring.main.allow-circular-references=true in your application.properties
 or application.yml. However, this is generally discouraged as it can mask underlying
 design issues and lead to unexpected behavior or initialization problems.
 5. @PostConstruct and ApplicationContextAware (Advanced)
 For more complex scenarios, you can use @PostConstruct to perform
 actions after all dependencies are injected, or implement ApplicationContextAware
  to manually access beans from the Spring context. These methods provide
  fine-grained control but are typically more involved.
