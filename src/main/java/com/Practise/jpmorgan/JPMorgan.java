/*
* ðŸ§  Rule of Thumb:
	â€¢	âœ… Use ArrayList when:
	â€¢	You mostly need random access (get(i))
	â€¢	Youâ€™re mainly adding/removing at the end
	â€¢	You want better performance with millions of records
	â€¢	âœ… Use LinkedList when:
	â€¢	You have lots of insertions/deletions in the middle
	â€¢	You donâ€™t need random access
	â€¢	Youâ€™re working with queues/stacks

â¸»

ðŸ’¡ With millions of records:
	â€¢	Most of the time, ArrayList is better due to better cache performance,
	* *  less memory overhead, and fast random access.
	â€¢	LinkedList can become memory-heavy and slower for iteration.

â¸»

ðŸ”¥ Pro Tip:

If youâ€™re hitting memory or performance issues with millions of records, consider:
	â€¢	Using ArrayDeque if youâ€™re building a queue/stack.
	â€¢	Using streams or paging/chunking techniques.
	â€¢	Using external databases or memory-mapped files if the dataset is too big for memory.
