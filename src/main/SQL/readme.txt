/*	There are no repeating groups (i.e., no multiple values in one column).
*/

2nd NF
/*There are no partial dependencies (i.e., no non-key attribute
  should depend only on a part of the primary key).
*/
3rd NF
/*
There are no transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes).
