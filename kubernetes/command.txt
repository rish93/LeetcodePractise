. is current directory in linux. So basicly: copy current local directory to the current
 container's directory.

The switch -p is used to configure port mapping. -p 2900:-3000 means publish
your local port 2900 to container's 3000 port so that the container is available on
 the outside (by your web browser for instance). Without that mapping the port would not be
 available to access outside the container.
This port is still available to other containers inside same docker network though
