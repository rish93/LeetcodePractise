    /*
    * Design schema for a movie booking system.
    * Create tables for movies, theaters, users, bookings, and payments.
    Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
    Include attributes like movie title, showtime, seat number, user details, booking status, payment details, etc.
    Consider implementing a booking algorithm to handle seat selection and availability.
    Ensure data integrity and normalization for efficient data retrieval and storage.

    * How would you scale the app (database wise) across India?
        Ans. To scale the app database over India, consider sharding, replication, and using cloud services.
        Implement sharding to distribute data across multiple servers based on geographic location or other criteria.
        Set up replication to ensure data consistency and availability in different regions.
        Utilize cloud services like AWS or Azure to easily scale resources based on demand.
        Optimize queries and indexes to improve database performance.
        Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and deliver static content efficiently.

        /*
        *What is the difference between sharding and partitioning?
        Ans. Sharding and partitioning are both techniques used in database management to improve performance and scalability by dividing data into smaller chunks.
        Sharding involves splitting a database into smaller, independent databases called shards, each responsible for a subset of the data.
        Partitioning involves dividing a database into smaller segments called partitions, each containing a subset of the data based on a defined criteria such as range or hash value.
        Sharding is typically used in distributed databases to distribute the workload and improve performance, while partitioning is often used in single-node databases to manage data more efficiently.
        Examples of sharding include MongoDB's sharded clusters, while examples of partitioning include MySQL's partitioning feature.

/*
* What are the 3 basic components of database, and do a RCA for why a DB is down.
Ans. The 3 basic components of a database are data, schema, and software. An RCA for a DB being down involves identifying the root cause of the issue.
Data: the actual information stored in the database, such as customer records or product details.
Schema: the structure that defines how the data is organized and related to each other, including tables, fields, and relationships.
Software: the database management system (DBMS) that allows users to interact with the data, such as MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.
RCA for a DB being down involves investigating factors like network issues, hardware failures, software bugs, or configuration errors.
For example, a DB could be down due to a network outage preventing communication with the server, or a hardware failure causing data corruption.

    /*üéØ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Indexes

üëâ What they are:
Indexes are special data structures that speed up queries by allowing the database to find rows quickly without scanning the whole table.

SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);


This speeds up:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';


‚ö†Ô∏è Tradeoff:
	‚Ä¢	Speeds up reads
	‚Ä¢	Slows down writes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) because index must be updated.
	‚Ä¢	Takes up storage.



üéØ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Stored Procedures

üëâ What they are:
A stored procedure is precompiled SQL logic stored in the DB, which can be executed with parameters.
They are used to encapsulate business logic, enforce rules closer to data, and sometimes improve performance.

üìå Example:
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE AddUser(IN name VARCHAR(50), IN email VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (name, email);
END //

DELIMITER ;

CALL AddUser('Ravi', 'ravi@example.com');



üéØ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Triggers

üëâ What they are:
Triggers are automatic actions that run when an event occurs ‚Äî like an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Use case: Keep audit logs, auto-update other tables.

üìå Example:

CREATE TRIGGER log_user_insert
AFTER INSERT ON users
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO audit_log (user_id, action, timestamp)
VALUES (NEW.id, 'INSERT', NOW());

üéØ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Design Problem

üëâ What it means:
How you design tables, keys, relationships, constraints to meet functional & non-functional requirements.

Key tips:
	‚Ä¢	Normalization: Avoid redundant data ‚Üí use 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.
	‚Ä¢	Primary Key: Unique ID for each row.
	‚Ä¢	Foreign Key: Link between tables.
	‚Ä¢	Indexes: Add wisely for performance.
	‚Ä¢	Check Constraints: Ensure valid data.

üìå Example: Movie Booking:
	‚Ä¢	movies ‚Üí showtimes ‚Üí bookings
	‚Ä¢	user_id FK in bookings ‚Üí users
	‚Ä¢	Add index on showtime_id + seat_number to prevent double booking.


	üéØ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Functions

üëâ What they are:
Stored user-defined functions (UDFs) that return a value. Unlike stored procedures, functions must return a value and can be used in SELECT.


CREATE FUNCTION getFullName(firstName VARCHAR(50), lastName VARCHAR(50))
RETURNS VARCHAR(100)
RETURN CONCAT(firstName, ' ', lastName);

SELECT getFullName('Ravi', 'Sharma');

üéØ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Transactions

üëâ What they are:
A transaction is a group of SQL operations executed as a single unit ‚Äî it either all succeeds or none does.
Ensures ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

üìå Example:

BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT; -- If both succeed
-- or ROLLBACK; if any fails


Concept   Example in a System
Index              Fast seat lookup, find user by email
Stored Procedure   Complex booking rules inside DB
Trigger            Auto-insert audit trail when booking created
Function           Format seat labels, calculate totals
Transaction        Book seats + confirm payment atomically
Schema Design      Normalize seats, bookings, payments


‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: When to be careful
	‚Ä¢	Too many indexes ‚Üí slow writes.
	‚Ä¢	Triggers ‚Üí can be hard to debug, hidden logic.
	‚Ä¢	Big stored procedures ‚Üí can lock you into one DB vendor.
	‚Ä¢	Long transactions ‚Üí risk of deadlocks.


‚úÖ ‚úÖ How to talk about this in an interview

üìå Sample line:

‚ÄúI‚Äôd design the booking flow so that the seat check and booking insert happen inside a DB transaction to guarantee atomicity.
I‚Äôd add indexes on showtime_id and seat_number for fast seat availability checks.
I might use a trigger to log booking changes for audit, or a stored procedure to handle seat allocation logic in the DB to reduce round trips.‚Äù
